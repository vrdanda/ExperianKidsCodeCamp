Write a few examples of algorithms we encounter in our daily lives:​
    Recipes​
    Sorting documents, music, movies, etc.​
    Traffic Signals​
    Elevators​
    Bus Schedules​

What are examples of efficient vs inefficient ways of implementing some of these algorithms.​

For instance how would mail delivery (the traditional mail :) ) be impacted if the only means of transportation is by foot?​

How many people would use the elevator if it stopped midway and went towards the most recent button pushed?
