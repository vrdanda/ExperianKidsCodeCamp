# How Do Dictionaries Work?

# Key and Value:
# Keys label the Values. For example, a fruit dictionary might have keys like
# "apple," "banana," and "orange." Each key corresponds to a value, such as
# the fruit colors.

# Accessing values:
# Use the key to retrieve values. Ask, "Hey, dictionary, tell me the color of
# the apple!" Python reveals the value ("red").


# Creating a Dictionary:
# Use curly braces {} with key-value pairs separated by colons.
fruit_colors = {"apple": "red", "banana": "yellow", "orange": "orange"}

# Getting Values:
# Retrieve values by specifying the key.
print(fruit_colors["banana"])  # Output: "yellow"

# Counting Secrets:
# Use len() to find out how many secrets your dictionary holds.
print(len(fruit_colors))  # Output: 3
