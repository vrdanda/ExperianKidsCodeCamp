#Finding Hidden Clues (Searching Spells)
#Suppose you’re searching for a clue in a mysterious book. Python can find it:
book = "Once upon a time..."
if "time" in book:
    print("Found the clue!")

#Changing Cases (Magic Caps)
#Python can turn letters into uppercase or lowercase:
whisper = "shhh"
shout = whisper.upper()
print(shout)  # Output: "SHHH"​

#Cutting Words (Slice Spells)
#Imagine you have a magical sword that can slice words:
spell = "abracadabra"
sliced = spell[2:6]  # Slice from index 2 to 5​
print(sliced)  # Output: "acad"​
